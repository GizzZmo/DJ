## Quick Start

### Using the Graphical User Interface

Start the visual DJ mixer:
```bash
python dj_gui.py
```

The GUI provides:
- **Dual Deck Controls**: Load and control two audio tracks independently
- **Visual Crossfader**: Smooth transitions with real-time position display
- **Volume Sliders**: Individual track volumes and master volume control
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, stop buttons for each deck
- **File Browser**: Easy track loading with standard file dialogs
- **Status Monitor**: Real-time display of mixer status and track information
- **ðŸ¤– AI Assistant**: Configure Gemini API for intelligent mixing features
- **Auto Mixing**: Start AI-powered automatic transitions between tracks
- **Key Analysis**: Get harmonic compatibility advice for smooth mixing
- **Fader Effects**: AI-suggested effects based on track characteristics

### Using the Command-Line Interface

Start the interactive DJ mixer:
```bash
python dj_cli.py
```

Basic commands:
```
DJ> init                    # Initialize the mixer
DJ> list                    # Show audio files in current directory
DJ> load deck1 song1.mp3    # Load a track to deck1
DJ> load deck2 song2.wav    # Load a track to deck2
DJ> play deck1              # Play deck1
DJ> volume deck1 0.8        # Set deck1 volume to 80%
DJ> crossfader 0.3          # Set crossfader position
DJ> cross deck1 deck2       # Apply crossfader between decks
DJ> status                  # Show mixer status
DJ> help                    # Show all available commands
```

### Using the AI Features

The DJ Mixer now includes intelligent AI-powered mixing capabilities:

```python
from ai_dj_assistant import AIDJAssistant

# Initialize AI assistant
ai = AIDJAssistant()

# Configure with Gemini API key (optional - works in mock mode without)
ai.configure_gemini("your-gemini-api-key")

# Analyze tracks for intelligent mixing
analysis = ai.analyze_track("deck1", "house_track.mp3")
print(f"Track: {analysis.tempo} BPM, Key: {analysis.key}, Energy: {analysis.energy}")

# Get AI mixing advice
advice = ai.get_auto_mixing_advice("deck1", "deck2")
print(f"Suggested crossfader position: {advice.crossfader_position}")

# Check harmonic compatibility
key_advice = ai.get_key_mixing_advice("deck1", "deck2")
print(f"Key compatibility: {key_advice['compatibility']}")

# Start automated mixing
ai.start_auto_mixing("deck1", "deck2")
```

#### AI Features:
- **Auto Mixing**: Analyzes tempo, key, and energy to create smooth transitions
- **Key Mixing**: Provides harmonic compatibility analysis using music theory
- **Fader Effects**: Suggests optimal effects based on track characteristics
- **Mock Mode**: Full functionality without requiring API key for testing

### Testing Without Audio Hardware

Run the mock test to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_mixer.py
```

Test the GUI functionality:
```bash
python test_gui.py
```

## Examples

Run the example demo:
```bash
python example.py
```

For detailed examples and audio file information:
```bash
python example.py --info
```

## GUI Interface

The DJ Mixer includes a professional graphical interface built with tkinter that provides visual control over all mixer functions:

### GUI Features
- **Professional Layout**: Traditional DJ mixer design with dual decks and central crossfader
- **File Management**: Easy track loading through standard file dialogs
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time status updates and visual indicators
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Large buttons and sliders for easy operation
- **Status Monitoring**: Comprehensive display of mixer state and track information

### GUI Controls
- **Initialize Button**: Start the audio mixer system
- **Load Track Buttons**: Browse and load audio files for each deck
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, and stop buttons for each deck
- **Volume Sliders**: Independent volume control for each track and master output
- **Crossfader Slider**: Smooth balance control between left and right decks
- **Apply Crossfader**: Apply the crossfader effect to the loaded tracks
- **Status Panel**: Real-time display of mixer status, track info, and system messages

## Audio Device Support

The mixer is designed to support multiple audio devices:

- **Main Output**: Primary speakers or PA system
- **Headphone Output**: DJ monitoring and cueing
- **Recording Output**: For recording or broadcasting
- **Additional Outputs**: Extra zones or devices

*Note: Current implementation uses pygame which abstracts device selection. For production use with specific device control, consider upgrading to PyAudio with ASIO drivers.*

## DJ Mixing Concepts

### Crossfading
- **Position 0.0**: Full left deck, right deck silent
- **Position 0.5**: Both decks at equal volume (center)
- **Position 1.0**: Full right deck, left deck silent

### Volume Control
- **Track Volume**: Individual volume for each loaded track
- **Master Volume**: Global volume affecting all outputs
- **Crossfader**: Relative volume control between two specific tracks

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
If you encounter audio initialization errors:

1. Check audio system availability:
```bash
# On Linux, check ALSA/PulseAudio
pulseaudio --check -v

# Test pygame audio
python -c "import pygame; pygame.mixer.init(); print('Audio OK')"
```

2. Use mock testing mode:
```bash
python test_mixer.py
```

3. Install audio dependencies:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-pygame libasound2-dev

# Other systems may require different audio libraries
```
